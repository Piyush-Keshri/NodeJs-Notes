//----------------------- THE REST ARCHITECTURE ------------------//

REST -- Representational States Transfer. /;

It is basically a way of building web APIs in a logical way,making them easy to consume.

To Build APIs following the REST Architecture following Principles are Followed :

1. Separate API into Logical resources.
2. Expose structured,resource-based URLs
3. Use HTTP methods -- Post,Get,Put,Patc,Delete.
4. Send Data as JSON
5. Be stateless.

Stateless Restful API -- All state is handled on the client.This means that each request must contain all the information necessary
                        to process a certain request. The server should not have to remember previous requests.
Examples of state -- loggedIn ,currentPage.
